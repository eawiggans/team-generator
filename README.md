# Team Generator


## Description
In order to keep track of and manage personnel, employers should have good internal systems for storing and viewing information that are simple to use and display information clearly and usefully. This app allows employers to enter information for different types of employees using the command line, and will dynamically generate HTML that allows the employer to view their team members visually in the browser.

## Usage
Users open the index file using node in the command line. They respond to prompts about what type of employee they want to enter information for, followed by requests for the required fields for each type of employee. When they opt to quit the program, an index.html file is generated using their inputs. When they view this file in the browser, they will see all their employees' information rendered in an organized manner.

## Tests
In the command line, the user can type 'npm run test' and test for the various class constructors will be run.
